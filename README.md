# Laughalytics

Ever wanted to see how much laughter there was in a space over a period of time and track how changes to that environment affected laughter? Yeah, maybe not a very common wish, but wanted to see if it could be done! This project was an attempt to use Machine Learning to detect laughter and record it by sending it to an API endpoint.
